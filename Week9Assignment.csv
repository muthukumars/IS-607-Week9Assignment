Top Most Good Review 1,This book is a very large gift in its compact,very short and understandable, it gives you accurate and concise answers,"This is a fantastic book and last I heard it became the best selling book of all time in its category and I can see why. It is a perfect example about how we are ""trained"" to think about money","My Engineering department constantly talks about Hadoop, Sqoop, Pig and Hive, and I was afraid that the zookeeper they referred to was somehow a real thing. ","Given the series' reputation, R for Dummies should be suited for readers with little or no experience in programming or R."
Top Most Good Review 2,This book is a very large gift in its compact, would recommend it to all human beings irrespective of religions ,I especially liked the excercises,I state that financial auditors shouldn't read this book because it goes against what they are taught.,"t covers a lot of aspects of big data, topics","""R For Dummies"" also provides useful directions to the various R online communities"
Top Most Good Review 3,A Fantastic Gift, A must have library collection,"This book is not ""for Dummies""","He also explains it to you like a third grader what the difference is between a ""liability"" and an ""asset"" which sadly, most people don't know.","I wish it had more general business elements, and the sections that deal with the problems and challenges of big data",I had not done any programming for at least 15 years. I had a project that needed programming. The R language was recommended to me. I had no experience with R so I bought this book. I found it an excellent way to learn the basics and the nuances of R. I recommend it highly.
Bad Review 1,"Emotionally, I was moved but I was  expecting something deeper or better written.",None,The book was a trendsetter in several ways,This book was a difficult read; I felt it was too drawn out but the message is worth the difficult read.,"I regret buying this book. No, it's not the money that I paid, I regret the time I spent trying to see if there was something that I could learn in it.",None
Bad Review 2," instead of finding inspiration, I was deeply disappointed and sometimes downright irritated.",None,No offense intended - but this is for the old version of ANSI C,"I had to read this book for a Nonprofit Fundraising class to think about how rich people think about money. For that reason, and that reason only, it was valuable. But my short Amazon review cannot do justice to how awful the book itself actually is. It is awful on so many levels, so I'll just cherry pick a few.","Incoherent. It was amazing to read things I understood already, and not understand the explanations. Apparently written piecemeal by committee.",None
